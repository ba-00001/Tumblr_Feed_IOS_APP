## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:
- Fetching data from the Tumblr API and parsing it correctly took some time to figure out, especially handling the nested JSON structure.
- Ensuring that images loaded efficiently and did not cause scroll lag required implementing caching, which was a learning curve.
- Adapting the UI to handle different post types and data availability required some thoughtful UI/UX design considerations.
